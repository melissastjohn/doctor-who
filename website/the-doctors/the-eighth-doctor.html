				<p lang="en">Portrayed by Paul McGann.</p>
				<p lang="en">Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien, a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.</p>
				<p lang="en">McGann portrays the eighth such incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only companion in the television movie is Grace Holloway, a medical doctor whose surgery is responsible for triggering his regeneration. In the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including self-styled &quot;Edwardian Adventures&quot; Charley, the alien Destrii and present-day humans Lucie and Sam.</p>
				<p lang="en">The Eighth Doctor made his first television appearance in the 1996 Doctor Who television movie, the first time the Doctor had returned to television screens since the end of the original series in 1989. Intended as a backdoor pilot for a new television series on the Fox Network, the movie managed to draw 5.5% of the U.S. audience, according to Nielsen Ratings. In the United Kingdom, it was recieved well, attracting over 9 million viewers and generally positive reviews. It was also generally well recieved in Australia.</p>
