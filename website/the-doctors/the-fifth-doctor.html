				<h2>Portrayed by Peter Davison.</h2>
				<p><img src="../images/the-doctors/the-fifth-doctor.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change. Davison portrays the fifth such incarnation, a staunch pacifist with a vulnerable side and a tendency towards indecisiveness, dressed as a boyish Edwardian cricketer. He travelled with a host of companions, including boy genius Adric, alien aristocrat Nyssa and Australian flight attendant Tegan Jovanka whom he had travelled alongside in his previous incarnation. He also shared later adventures alongside devious schoolboy Vislor Turlough and American college student Perri Brown.</p>
				<p>After Tom Baker, the Fourth Doctor, and the BBC had announced that he was leaving the role, the show's producers decided that the next Doctor was to be played by someone who presented something of a physical contrast to Baker and by an actor who was already firmly established in the British public's mind. Peter Davison was chosen due to his critically acclaimed role as Tristan Farnon in the BBC series All Creates Great and Small<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Creatures_Great_and_Small_(TV_serial)" title="All Creatures Great and Small (TV serial)"></a></em> which had <em>Doctor Who</em> producr John-Nathan Turner as line producer.</p>
				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Doctor#cite_note-4"></a>The Fifth Doctor's era was notable for a "back to the basics" attitude, in which "silly" humour (and, to an extent, horror) was kept to a minimum, and more scientific accuracy was encouraged by the producer, John-Nathan Turner. It was, at times, a darker and grittier series, in part for seeing the death of one of his companions, Adric<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adric" title="Adric"></a>. It was also notable for the reintroduction of many of the Time Lord's enemies, such as the Master, Cybermen, Omega, the Black and White Guardians, and the Sulurians.</p>
