				<p lang="en">Portrayed by Steven Moffat.</p>
				<p lang="en">The Weeping Angels are an ancient race of aliens from the long running sci fi series Doctor Who. Steven Moffat, their creator, attributes their appeal to childhood games such as Grandmother's Footsteps and the notion that every statue is secretly a Weeping Angel.[1]<br>
				Their usual mode of feeding is to send their victims back in time, which creates time energy to feed on. When they are not being observed by another being, they can move very quickly and silently, but when they are being observed, they become &quot;quantum-locked&quot;, occupying a single position in space and becoming stone. In this state, they are frozen and difficult to destroy. They cannot suppress this reaction. If two Weeping Angels were to look at each other at the same time, they would be trapped in stone form until an outside force moves them apart. To prevent this, they often cover their eyes while moving, which makes them look as though they are weeping.</p>
				<p lang="en">According to The Doctor, the Weeping Angels &quot;are as old as the universe (or very nearly), but no one really knows where they come from.&quot; He describes them as the loneliest beings in the universe, since their quantum-lock reaction makes it difficult for them to socialise; he also describes them as &quot;the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life-form evolution has ever produced.&quot; That said, in all their TV appearances, the Angels could communicate with each other and work in groups. They are also very physically strong, capable of snapping necks, though physically killing a victim is rare for them unless the need arises (such as stealing someone's voice). In the episode &quot;The Angels Take Manhattan&quot;, another form of Weeping Angel is shown, the cherubim.[2] Unlike the Weeping Angels they are not silent, making a childlike giggling and having audible footsteps. It is not explicitly stated that they are young Angels, but they are referred to as &quot;the babies&quot;. The Weeping Angels possess several notable abilities. In &quot;The Time of Angels&quot; it is suggested that when Angels need bodies for communication they snap their victim's neck and rearrange the brains for their purposes. The Angels speak in their victim's voice, as &quot;Angel Bob&quot;, a fallen soldier of the Church, becomes the &quot;voice&quot; of the Angels and explains the Angels' motives and thoughts to the Doctor. As they close on more aware victims, their features transform from calm angels with normal proportions to more horrific, bestial demons with wide open mouths baring vampiric teeth and clawed hands. Their paramount ability is their speed, as they are able to close distances of metres literally in the blink of an eye, allowing them to reach a victim or move to an unseen or darkened area before their quantum-lock freezes them again.</p>
				<p lang="en"><br>
					With a touch, a Weeping Angel can send a person into the past, to before his/her own birth. The Angels feed off the &quot;potential energy&quot; of the years their victims would have lived in the present. The Doctor describes them as &quot;the only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely&quot; because their victims are otherwise uninjured and may live out their lifespans in the past. They can drain other forms of energy, such as that from electric lights, as seen in the Season 3 episode &quot;Blink&quot;, or other electronics. Without power, the Angels start to decay, turn to stone without being watched, and corrode as a statue does; their speed is also extremely hindered if Angels reach starvation, as seen in The Time of Angels, lessened from meters to a partial step in a blink. This can be undone by providing the Angels with energy, but it is implied they can no longer acquire energy themselves in this state. In &quot;Blink,&quot; the Angels attempted to steal the Doctor's TARDIS after trapping him in the past. The engine of the vehicle contained enough time energy to feed them forever but the damage could switch off the sun. </p>
