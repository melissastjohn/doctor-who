				<p>Portrayed by Arthur Darvill.</p>
				<p>Rory Arthur Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.[1] Having been introduced at the start of the 5th series, Rory joins the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5.[2][3][4] As Amy Pond's fiancé, Rory is initially insecure because he believes Amy secretly loves the Doctor more. Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy marry. The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth. In &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;, Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend River Song is actually their daughter Melody Pond. The Doctor and River marry in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law. In &quot;The Angels Take Manhattan&quot;, the fifth episode of the seventh series, he and Amy are transported back in time by a Weeping Angel, leading to the couple's departure from the series.</p>
				<p>Rory is introduced in &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; (2010) as a nurse in a coma ward and the &quot;sort of boyfriend&quot; of new companion Amelia Pond (Karen Gillan). He is shocked to meet Amy's 'imaginary' &quot;Raggedy Doctor&quot; - the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), whom he instantly recognises from Amy's childhood stories.[5] Two years later, Amy absconds on the eve of their wedding to travel with the Doctor, whom at the end of an initial travelling period she tries to seduce.[6] In response, the Doctor takes Amy and Rory to 1580s Venice to repair and strengthen the couple's relationship; at the end of the episode Rory joins them as a travelling companion.[7] In &quot;Amy's Choice&quot;, in a shared realistic dream where he is a doctor married to a pregnant Amy, he tells her with his dying breath to look after their baby, which causes Amy to realise how much she loves him.[8] Rory travels with the Doctor and Amy until Series 5, Episode 9 &quot;Cold Blood&quot;, in which he is shot dead by a Silurian after saving the Doctor and then absorbed by a crack in time and space, erasing him from existence and from Amy's memory.[9] Rory appears in &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;, as a Roman soldier in 102 C.E., but is revealed to be an Auton with Rory's memories. He attempts to fight his Auton programming, but unwillingly shoots Amy.[10] In the Series 5 finale episode,&quot;The Big Bang&quot;, the duplicate Rory preserves Amy in stasis using a futuristic prison called the Pandorica, watching over her for almost two millennia. He becomes known as the &quot;Last Centurion&quot;, guarding the Pandorica wherever it is taken. The Auton Rory assists the Doctor, Amy, and River Song (Alex Kingston) in saving the universe from the explosion that caused the cracks in time. Restored to his original timeline but still possessing memories of his Auton existence, Rory marries Amy.[11] They continue traveling with the Doctor who allows them a honeymoon, which they are said to be on in both The Sarah Jane Adventures serial Death of the Doctor and the Christmas special &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.[12]</p>
