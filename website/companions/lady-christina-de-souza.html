				<h1 id="firstHeading" lang="en">Lady Christina De Souza</h1>
				<h2 lang="en">Portrayed by Michelle Ryan.</h2>
				<p><img src="../images/the-companions/lady-christina.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">Christina de Souza was a notorious thief who stole for thrill, rather than profit as most thieves would; she was bored with her aristocratic upbringing. When she met the Tenth Doctor, Christina had already built a considerable reputation and was relentlessly pursued by Detective Inspector Macmillan.</p>
				<p>At Easter 2009, she stole the prized Cup of Athelstan from the International Gallery in London. Her calling card (a mechanical golden Maneki Neko waving in a mocking manner) alerted the guards to her presence and her associate was quickly found and arrested, which concerned Christina not at all. Unable to find a way to distance herself from the museum because of the many police officers about, she used the 200 bus as an escape vehicle, bribing the driver with her diamond earrings for passage. When she met the Doctor, she dismissed him due to his odd behaviour. Once the bus was caught in a wormhole and deposited on an alien planet, she established herself as the leader of the group. She deferred to the Doctor's knowledge, recognising his understanding of the situation. The many tools in her backpack, which included a shovel to dig out the bus wheels, a hatchet to cut away the seats (so they could be used as traction for the wheels), a mechanical winch for her heists and a hammer, proved to be of enormous value to the group.</p>
				<p><br>
					Christina became very comfortable with the Doctor and he with her. She felt a sense of adventure and excitement with him that exceeded any heist that she had ever pulled off. Against the Doctor's wishes, she winched down a shaft in the Tritovores' ship to collect the anti-gravity clamps and their power crystal, nearly electrocuting herself in her haste. She inadvertently woke an inactive alien in the ship's hull with her body heat. Swiftly collecting the clamps, she travelled back up the shaft with the alien at her heels.</p>
